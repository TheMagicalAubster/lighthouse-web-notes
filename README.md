# Aubrey Blair-Pattison's Notes

### Summary 

This repository contains all of the notes taken by Aubrey Blair-Pattison for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.

#### Day 1
Getting acquainted with everyone in the same cohort, we introduced ourselves, and went through some basic orientation stuff. I requested help TWICE. For technical things - Git not connecting and Vagrant needing to be "halt"-ed aka rebooted. Go figure. If it doesn't work, turn it off and on again.
